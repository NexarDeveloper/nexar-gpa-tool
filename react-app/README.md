# Example React App

In this folder you can find an example react project with the Stock Locator Tool embedded.
This will not work in it's current form on it's own as it will try to fetch a token from `localhost:5000`.

## Prerequisites

You must have a [Nexar](nexar.com) account and application with the supply scope. You can either hardcode a token in or also check out the `express-app` folder which contains an app that will provide tokens on `localhost:5000`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
